# Node-network
Node network for Avalanche Blockchain. Open - source. 
I am thrilled to announce my latest update to the eon3.vercel.app project that I am currently working on, and I would like to invite you to contribute to it with me. The project is called "EON CLOUD" and it aims to be the go-to tool for managing Avalanche nodes on a network. EON CLOUD is a node management tool that allows users to easily create, configure, and manage Avalanche nodes on a network. The tool is designed to be both user-friendly and flexible, providing powerful features to allow users to fully customize their nodes and network infrastructure.

 The tool also allows node runners to offer up their storage space in exchange for tokens. This is accomplished through the integration of the Avalanche X-Chain. With EON CLOUD, node runners can offer up their storage space as a service and receive tokens in exchange.

For example, a node runner might have extra storage capacity on their server that they are not currently using. By offering up this space as a service to other users on the network, they can receive tokens as compensation. This creates a win-win situation, where users can benefit from increased storage capacity and node runners can earn tokens for providing the service. This feature opens up new possibilities for the Avalanche network, as it allows for the creation of a decentralized storage network that is powered by the nodes on the network. This not only increases the overall storage capacity of the network but also provides a way for node runners to earn tokens for their contributions, further incentivizing their participation.

In conclusion, the ability to offer up storage space as a service through EON CLOUD is an exciting development for the network. It provides a new way for users to gain access to storage capacity, while also creating new opportunities for node runners to earn tokens for their contributions. With this feature, the Avalanche network becomes even more decentralized, robust, and resilient. So, come and join me in building the best management tool for Avalanche nodes, EON CLOUD! #development #project #cloud #network #building #infrastructure #opensource #avalanche #avax #decentralized #nodes #node #noderunner #noderunnerRewards #EON #eon
